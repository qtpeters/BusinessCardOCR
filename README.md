Weâ€™ve created a new smartphone app that enables users to snap a photo of a business card 
and have the information from the card automatically extracted and added to their contact list. 
We need you to write the component that parses the results of the optical character recognition (OCR) 
component in order to extract the name, phone number, and email address from the processed business card image. 
We have provided you with a basic interface specification [1] and a series of example inputs [2] and 
would like you to provide the implementation.

[1] INTERFACE SPECIFICATION

interface IContactInfo
    String getName() : returns the full name of the individual (eg. John Smith, Susan Malick)
        String getPhoneNumber() : returns the phone number formatted as a sequence of digits with no punctuation
            String getEmailAddress() : returns the email address of the individual

            interface IBusinessCardParser
                IContactInfo getContactInfo(String document)
                [2] EXAMPLE INPUT DOCUMENTS AND THEIR EXPECTED RESULTS
